Make all albums have URLs like
https://host.name/gallery/v/name/name/name

1) Apache rewrite rule for those nice URLs to 
..../plugins/SeoMadeEasy/doRedirect.php?t=album&p=/Together '17/Tom's Mum's 65th

rewriteRule /gallery/v/(.*) /photos/plugins/SeoMadeEasy/doRedirect.php?t=album&p=$1

This current issues a redirect to the correct URL.

2) Get Piwigo to generate nice URLs for Gallery :
TODO

Future
* get into Piwigo extensions list (depends on outcome of http://piwigo.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=168210#p168210 )
* remove redirect : get include of index.php to work or something clever with mod_rewrite (rewriteMap prg ... ?)
* similar for images
